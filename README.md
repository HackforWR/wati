Introduction
----------------
This repository hosts the Live without tobacco ("Viva sem Tabaco") project - the first open-source web-assisted tobacco intervention, developed and maintained by the Center for Research, Intervention and Evaluation for Alcohol and Drugs from Federal University of Juiz de Fora / Brazil. 

The intervention is adapted from the widely accepted guidelines *Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence* (U.S Departament of Health and Human Services). The project website [link](http://crepeia.github.io/wati) and the intervention page [link](http://www.vivasemtabaco.com.br)

Feel free to contact us if you would like to translate or adapt it to other languages or platforms. We are working on English, Spanish and German versions now.
