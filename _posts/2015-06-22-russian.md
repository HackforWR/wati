Dr. Dmytro Khvotenko, a Postdoctoral Researcher (and also owner of the lovely pug Axel), has translated the Viva sem Tabaco content into Russian. Russian is the official language in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan and widely spoken language in Ukraine, Moldova, Latvia, Estonia, and to a lesser extent, the other countries that were once constituent republics of the Soviet Union. It is estimated that 260 million people speak russian[^1]. Besides, approximately half of russian men smoke[^2].

The full support of Russian is expected to come out at the end of 2015. We would also like to invite the scientific community from Russian to join our project! :)
