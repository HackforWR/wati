"Live without tobacco" - the first open source web-assisted tobacco intervention is released. After 1 year of development, the portuguese version of the intervention is finally released. Now, we are seeking parterns for testing and translating in other languages. 

The code is available in our github repository.

In the next weeks, we are going to upload the documentation for install the intervention in your computer.
