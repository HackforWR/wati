After some time of fine tunning, a new version of Viva sem Tabaco is now available. The main change was its new front-end, now mobile-friendly. Besides, we have corrected bugs and made minor adjustments. 

We created the new layout using [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/), a responsive front-end framework based on Material Design. With the new layout, we will be able to address the fast growing number of accesses from mobile devices.

The code was also optimized in order to increase performance and reduce loading time.
