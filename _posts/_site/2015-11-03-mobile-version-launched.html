<p>After some time of fine tunning, a new version of Viva sem Tabaco is now available. The main change was its new front-end, now mobile-friendly. Besides, we have corrected bugs and made minor adjustments.</p>

<p>We created the new layout using <a href="http://materializecss.com/">Materialize CSS</a>, a responsive front-end framework based on Material Design. With the new layout, we will be able to address the fast growing number of accesses from mobile devices.</p>

<p>The code was also optimized in order to increase performance and reduce loading time.</p>
