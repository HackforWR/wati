<p>We are pleased to announce that Browserstack is offering us their Live plan for free. Why did they do that? Our project is open-source and they love to support open-source projects.</p>

<h2 id="what_is_browser_stack">What is Browser Stack?</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.browserstack.com/"><img src="../../images/browserstack.png" alt="Browserstack" /></a></p>

<p>Are you bored testing the compatibility of your website across the infinite number of browsers and OS’s?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.browserstack.com/">BrowserStack</a> offers to developers instant access to all desktop and mobile browsers, making your compatibility tests way easier.</p>

<p>If you also work on an open-source project, you can apply for a free license (they will gently ask you to add their logo on your project’s page). They also offer special prices for freelancers and a 30-day free trial.</p>
