<p>Good news!! We have been certified by the Health on the Net Foundation. What does it mean? It means that our content is compliant with the Code of Ethics of the most used and trustworthy code for medical and health information available on Internet. This is good for intervention users and also good for researchers and developers. As you probably know, Viva sem Tabaco is open-source and you are able build on it.

<p>We are also seeking collaboration partners because it is really hard to keep all languages updated. So if you can speak English, Spanish, German or Russian, you are more than encouraged to reach us. If you know a different language, you can also translate the project and help smokers quitting. Students are more than welcome!</p>
