Caroline Jansen, an exchange student in Brazil and also a very kind person, is going to translate the intervention to German. She has lived in Brazil for about 9 months studying at Federal University of Juiz de Fora and working at General Consulate of Germany (deutschen Auslandsvertretungen) in Rio de Janeiro.

The german version is expected to come out at the end of 2014.
