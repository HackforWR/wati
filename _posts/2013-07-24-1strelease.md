We are pleased to announce that the 0.2 version is released called [Cesar Lattes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Lattes). We have improved the e-mail feedback and quitplans with standard messages. We also fixed minor bugs.

The code is available in our [github repository](http://crepeia.github.io/wati).

English and Spanish versions are expected to come out in late August.
