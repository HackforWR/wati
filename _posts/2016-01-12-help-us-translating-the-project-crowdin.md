Happy 2016! We'd love to announce we are using Crowdin, a crowdsourcing translation platform. So helping us delivering free education for smokers was never so easy. By now, we have committed volunteers working on the German, Russian, Italian and Japanese versions. 

## How to translate in simple three steps

1. Create an account for free [here](https://crowdin.com/join)
2. Open our [project's page](https://crowdin.com/project/livewithouttobacco) and choose a language.
3. Begin translating :)

Your work is automatically saved after right after you write your translation. In a matter of days, we validate and update your translation in our website.

## What can you get for translating

We're offering credit for translators who are committed to our project by adding a picture and a brief description of their work at the "About the authors" page. If you are interesting in getting credit, reach us at henriquepgomide@gmail.com.
