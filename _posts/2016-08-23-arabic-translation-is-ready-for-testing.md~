It's been a while since our last post, but this does not mean we stopped Viva sem Tabaco development. 

With all kindness and support from @Mumtaz76, a Jordanian lawyer and translator/proofreader, the intervention is now available in Arabic. Arabic (العَرَبِيَّة) is spoken in a wide stretching across Western Asia, North Africa, and the Horn of Africa. It is estimated that 420 million people speak arabic natively[^1].

The full support of arabic is expected to come out at the end of September. We would also like to invite the scientific community to join our project! It's open-source! :)
