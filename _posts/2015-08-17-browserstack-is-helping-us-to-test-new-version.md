We are pleased to announce that Browserstack is offering us their Live plan for free. Why did they do that? Our project is open-source and they love to help open-source projects.

## What is Browser Stack?

[![Browserstack](../../images/browserstack.png)](https://www.browserstack.com/)

Are you bored testing the compatibility of your website across the infinite number of browsers and OS's? 

[BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) offers to developers instant access to all desktop and mobile browsers, making your compatibility tests way easier.

If you also work on an open-source project, you can apply for a free license (they will gently ask you to add their logo on your project's page). They also offer special prices for freelancers and a 30-day free trial.
