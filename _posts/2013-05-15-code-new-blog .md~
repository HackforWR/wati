After 2 months working on code, the system is ready to translation. If you like to contribute and help spread the support of smoking cessation support, you just need to reach the spreadsheet in Google Docs.

At this moment, we just support Brazilian portuguese. The English and Spanish versions are expected to be released on August.

Happy translation :)
