Who are our users? It's been a while since Viva sem Tabaco has been launched, but no data were available on how users interact with the web-based intervention. To address this question, Nathalia Munck presented a poster presentation at the "V Congresso Internacional sobre Drogas", which happened between November fifth and seventh in Sao Joao del Rey - Brazil.
