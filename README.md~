Introduction
----------------
This repository hosts the Live without tobacco ("Viva sem Tabaco") project - the first open-source web-assisted tobacco intervention, developed and maintained by the Center for Research, Intervention and Evaluation for Alcohol and Drugs from Federal University of Juiz de Fora / Brazil. 

The intervention is adapted from the widely accepted guidelines *Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence* (U.S Departament of Health and Human Services). The project website [link](http://crepeia.github.io/wati). and the intervention page [link](http://www.vivasemtabaco.com.br).

Feel free to contact us if you would like to translate or adapt it to other languages or platforms. We need help on on English, Spanish German and Russian versions now. If you are a researcher, student, or a geek contact us. We'd love to collaborate and do open-science.
