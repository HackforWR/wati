## Before you get started

1. [Install Bundler](http://bundler.io) `gem install bundler` and then install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and all dependencies `bundle install`.
2. Fork the [So Simple Theme repo](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/fork).
3. Clone the repo you just forked and rename it.
4. Edit `_config.yml` to personalize your site.
5. Check out the sample posts in `_posts` to see examples for pulling in large feature images, assigning categories and tags, and other YAML data.
6. Read the documentation below for further customization pointers and documentation.

**Pro-tip:** Delete the `gh-pages` branch after cloning and start fresh by branching off `master`. There is a bunch of garbage in `gh-pages` used for the theme's demo site that I'm guessing you don't want on your site.
