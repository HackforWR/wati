Looking to provide a web assisted tobacco intervention in your country?
Quite easy! See what we have done so far and what is going next.

## What is this?
This is the repository of the first open-source tobacco intervention, a fully-automated website built mainly using Java and open-source software. The content is based on widely accepted guidelines for tobacco and dependence treatment[^1] and scientific research[^2][^3].

[^1]: U.S Department of Health Services. Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence: 2008 Update. 2008.
[^2]: Civljak M, Sheikh A, Stead LF, Car J. Internet-based interventions for smoking cessation. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2010;(9):CD007078.

## Live without tobacco is all about
 * Provide a free smoking cessation service based on the latest scientific research.
 * Multilanguage. To translate, just update a common spreadsheet and **voilá**.
 * Open-source! We just love free software - even the graphics and animations.
 * Compatibility with older browers and not so big screen resolutions (pretty common in developing countries).
 
## Who are we?
We are a team of researchers with different backgrounds (drug addiction, psychology, IT) from Federal University of Juiz de Fora. We love open-source and strongly believe in open-science. Of course, we also believe that healthcare access should be free for all.

## Who pays the bill?
For now, all funding comes from research agencies in Brazil. We are really thankful to FAPEMIG, CAPES and CNPq.

## What's next?
Well, depends on you. In the following years, we are going to study:

 * User satisfaction,
 * Personalise the intervention using Data Mining and Machine Learning algorithms.
 * Test its efficacy in Brazil.
