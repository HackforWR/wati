### Java

To download the project we recommend the git program. With git you will be able to fork the project and distribute the code easily. To install, type on terminal:

```

```

## Donwload

To download, just open the terminal and type.

```
git clone https://github.com/crepeia/wati.git
```

Done. Now the project folder is located in your home folder "~".

## Set the database

We are are almost there. We just need to set the database. Follow these instructions to create the database. Open the terminal (again!) and type:

```
mysql -u root -p
```

You need to insert your root password (the one that you should've put in the safe). You need to run the following commands:

```
create user wati@localhost identified by "wati1235";
```

```
create database wati;
```

```
grant all privileges on wati.* to wati@localhost;
```

VoilÃ¡! Now everything is set to run the project on your machine. 


## Run

If you have completed the steps above. Open Netbeans, go to files - > open project and browse to the donwloaded folder. Now execute de project using the run command.

## Translation

The translation files are located in "Source Packages" folder, inside the controller "wati-utility". They all have names starting with messages_xx_properties.

---


## Graphics

### Images and Vectors
The images are in Web Pages -> resources -> default -> images. If you like to change and adapt them, use the vector file 'img-vector.svg' located in /flowchart and request folder. We recommend the open-source software [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/en/) to work with vector graphics.

### Video
You can download the editable intro video [here](http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/71482). To create the intro video, we used Blender, an all-around open-source 3d editor. You can download it [here](http://www.blender.org/). Be advised: blender is tricky and has a steep learning curve, feel free to reach us.

### Stylesheet
The CSS code is located in Web Pages -> resources -> default -> css.
